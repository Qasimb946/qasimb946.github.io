# Physics Informed Neural Networks
This blog is mainly about the general idea of how Physics Informed Neural Networks and the intuition behind it. A blog post for someone who is a beginner and has never heard about Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## PINNs in Simple Words
"Using Neural networks architecture and customizing the Loss function by embedding physics rules as a regularized term to train a model that could know how physics works"


## Motivation
The gap between Deep Learning and Physical Systems becomes more apparent when we have limited data, and we need to make predictions outside the range of the available samples (extrapolation). This is where Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) shine and offer a compelling solution. PINNs address this issue by incorporating known physical laws or constraints directly into the learning process. By embedding physics within the neural network architecture, PINNs can exploit prior knowledge about the physical system, even when only a limited number of samples are available.
