# Physics Informed Neural Networks
This blog is mainly about the general idea of how Physics Informed Neural Networks and the intuition behind it. A blog post for someone who is a beginner and has never heard about Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## PINNs in simple words
"Using Neural networks architecture and customizing the Loss function by embedding physics rules as a regularized term to train a model that could know how physics works"
